A simple jQuery plugin allowing you to navigate using the "j" and "k" keys like on http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/.

Example for enabling j/k navigation for posts on a blog:

$('.post').jknavigable();

By default the class "active" is added to the active element, though this can be changed with:

$('.post').jknavigable({'activeClass': 'someClass'});
